This is a simple project I used to learn php. It comes from the udemy course [PHP for Beginners - Become a PHP Master - CMS Project](http://www.udemy.com/course/php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented/).

I modified the database acces to use an ORM called [ReadBean PHP](https://www.redbeanphp.com/index.php)
